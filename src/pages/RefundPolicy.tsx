              </h2>
              <p>
                Most projects require an initial deposit before work begins.
                These deposits are generally non-refundable as they secure our
                resources for your project. However, exceptions may be
                considered under the following circumstances:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>
                  If we fail to commence work within the agreed timeframe
                  (typically 30 days from deposit payment), you may request a
                  full refund of your deposit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If unforeseen circumstances prevent us from delivering the
                  agreed services, a partial or full refund may be issued at our
                  discretion.

                  receive all work completed up to the point of cancellation.

                <li>

                payment is considered payment for work completed up to that
                point. Once a milestone is approved and payment is made, that
